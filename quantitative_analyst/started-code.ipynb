    "_Reasoning_: We use a similar approach as before. Self join the table on id and manager_id, but this time to get a list of employees from \"first\" table i.e. people who are managers. Then we use it as a subquery to get the list of names that aren't anyone's manager. Once we have that, we can simply take an average of the salary, which in this case is `425.00`."

    "_Reasoning_: The comments should be enough to follow along. Basically, we are running a for loop, and at every step checking the previous layer to update the current layer. At the end, in python, it is a list of lists and we print the results. This is a brute force of getting the result and am sure there's an efficient way to solve this by taking advantage of the fact that Pascal's Triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients. Using multiple for loops and lists is neither memory nor compute efficient."
